# CTA_Tracker
Intern Project - CTA Tracker

This is a project I created for one of my internships to pull data from a publicly available API the CTA provides and push that to a service we have in office called GeckoBoard. Gecko Board is then able to visually display the current status & eta of the trains customized to the stops near our office.
